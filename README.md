# Your task: the data harvester  üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to create a program that harvest real time usage information
about the users of `video streaming events' server`. The details of the platform and a list of the requirements are available down below.  
In order to fulfill the assignment, you will have to consume three streaming endpoints by running the video streaming events' server on your machine as described [here.](#how-to-run-the-video-streaming-events-server-locally)

## The video streaming events server üì∫ ##

The `video streaming events server` exposes near real-time information regarding tv shows and movies streamed by users
on 3 fictitious streaming platform: `Sytflix`, `Sytazon` and `Sysney`.  
Each of the endpoint exposes infinite stream representing either the start of a streaming (`stream-started`) ,
the end of a streaming (`stream-ended`), liking a show (`show-liked`) or a problem during the streaming of a show
(`stream-interrupted`).

An example message from the stream is shown below:

```
id:664c318c-6f36-424f-adb9-56f7861aba27
event:show-liked
data:{
  "show": {
    "show_id": "s8105",
    "cast": "Marlon Brando, Bruce Willis",
    "country": "Netherlands, Belgium",
    "date_added": "April 7, 2017",
    "description": "A quarter-century later, this documentary relocates the male dancers who backed Madonna on her 1990 Blond Ambition tour, as seen in \"Truth or Dare.",
    "director": "Ester Gould, Reijer Zwaan",
    "duration": "85 min",
    "listed_in": "Documentaries, International Movies, LGBTQ Movies",
    "rating": "TV-MA",
    "release_year": 2016,
    "title": "Strike a Pose",
    "type": "Movie",
    "platform": "Sytflix"
  },
  "event_date": "27-02-2023 03:20:17.111",
  "user": {
    "id": 116,
    "date_of_birth": "31/10/1970",
    "email": "gbeeton37@wikimedia.org",
    "first_name": "Guenna",
    "gender": "Female",
    "ip_address": "96.34.189.33",
    "country": "TH",
    "last_name": "Beeton"
  }
}

```

The `event_date` specifies the user's local time. `Amsterdam (CET)` is the default time zone.
For the users residing in the countries specified in the table below, the `event_date` is provided
in the corresponding time zone.

| User's Residence Country | Country Code | `event_date` Time Zone       |
|--------------------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Portugal                 | PT           | Europe/Lisbon (UTC)          |
| Canada                   | CA           | America/Toronto (UTC -5)     |
| United States            | US           | America/Los_Angeles (UTC -8) |
| Russia                   | RU           | Europe/Moscow (UTC +3)       |
| Indonesia                | ID           | Asia/Jakarta (UTC +7)        |
| China                    | CN           | Asia/Shanghai (UTC +8)       |

### How to run the video streaming events server locally
You will need Docker installed on your machine. And then from the terminal type:

For Intel/AMD x64 based CPUs:  
```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 sytacdocker/video-stream-server:latest
```

For Arm based CPUs (Apple with M1/M2 chip):  
```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 sytacdocker/video-stream-server-arm:latest
```

Once the server is running, you will have several endpoints available on your machine:
- [Sytflix](http://localhost:8080/sytflix) (`http://localhost:8080/sytflix`);
- [Sytazon](http://localhost:8080/sytazon) (`http://localhost:8080/sytazon`);
- [Sysney](http://localhost:8080/sysney) (`http://localhost:8080/sysney`).

All the endpoints are protected by username and password (basic auth):
```
username = sytac
password = 4p9g-Dv7T-u8fe-iz6y-SRW2
```

## Mandatory requirements to implement üìú ##

Your application should collect the data of all three streams for 20 seconds or until the third occurrence
of a user with first name `Sytac` on either of streams, whichever comes first.

The application should output the aggregated view of the data collected, detailing:

+ user id
+ user's name and surname
+ user's age
+ all the events that the user has executed
+ platform where each event has occurred
+ the show titles
+ the first person in the cast for each show, if present
+ the show ids
+ event time in  Amsterdam (CET) timezone and `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss.SSS` format

and also:

+ the total number of shows released in 2020 or later (for any type of event)
+ for how long the 3 streams were consumed, in milliseconds

The output should be either:

- printed on standard output, or
- written into a file, or
- returned via an HTTP GET request.

You decide the output format and output method, observing that the output data is easily
interpreted by another program **and humans**.

<details>
  <summary>Short on time? Here is a hint üí°</summary>

  ```kotlin
    "PT" -> "UTC"
    "CA" -> "America/Toronto"
    "US" -> "America/Los_Angeles"
    "RU" -> "Europe/Moscow"
    "ID" -> "Asia/Jakarta"
    "CN" -> "Asia/Shanghai"
  ```
</details>

  <summary>Here is another hint, for good luck üí°üí°</summary>
  
   
Unfortunately, the server is bugged: from time to time the data returned is not well-formed.
</details>

## Bonus points üåü ##

> The following requirements are optional. Develop these if you are looking to impress us!  

Along with the Mandatory requirements, collect:  

- the total number of `successful streaming events` per user:
  - a successful streaming event is a defined as (sub)sequence of a `stream-started`, followed right after temporally by a `stream-ended` for the same show id and platform. For Example:
    - `[{stream-started, s_01, sytflix, 01_01_2000}, {stream-ended, s_01, sytflix, 01_01_2001}]` => successful event  
    - `[{stream-started, s_01, sytflix, 01_01_2000}, {stream-ended, s_01, sytazon, 01_01_2001}]` => nothing (different platforms)  
    - `[{stream-started, s_01, sytflix, 01_01_2000}, {stream-ended, s_02, sytflix, 01_01_2001}]` => nothing (different shows)
    - `[{stream-started, s_01, sytflix, 01_01_2000}, {show_liked, s_01, sytflix, 01_06_2000}, {stream-ended, s_01, sytflix, 01_01_2001}]` => successful event  
    - `[{stream-ended, s_01, sytflix, 01_01_2000}, {stream-started, s_01, sytflix, 01_01_2001}]` => nothing (no stream end event)

- the percentage of started stream events out of all events occurred on the `Sytflix` platform
